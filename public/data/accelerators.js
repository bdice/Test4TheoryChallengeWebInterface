So if particles, bound together in atoms, are the basic units of matter, it is natural to think that antiparticles, bound together in antiatoms, are the basic units of antimatter.</p>\n<p>But are matter and antimatter exactly equal and opposite, or symmetric, as Dirac had implied? The next important step was to test this symmetry. Physicists wanted to know how subatomic antiparticles behave when they come together. Would an antiproton and an antineutron stick together to form an antinucleus, just as protons and neutrons stick together to form the nucleus of an atom?</p>\n<p>The answer to the antinuclei question was found in 1965 with the observation of the antideuteron, a nucleus of antimatter made out of an antiproton plus an antineutron (while a deuteron &ndash; the nucleus of the deuterium atom &ndash; is made of a proton plus a neutron). The goal was simultaneously achieved by two teams of physicists, one led by Antonino Zichichi using the Proton Synchrotron at CERN, and the other led by Leon Lederman, using the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) accelerator at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York.</p>\n<p>The CERN paper, <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/ch673h285360045w/\"><em>Experimental Observation of Antideuteron Production</em></a> was published in the Italian particle-physics journal <em>Il nuovo cimento</em> on 1 September 1965 (the journal ended when it was merged into the <em>European Physical Journal</em> in 1999.</p>\n",

In 1968, Georges Charpak developed the &ldquo;multiwire proportional chamber&rdquo;, a gas-filled box with a large number of parallel detector wires, each connected to individual amplifiers. Linked to a computer, it could achieve a counting rate a thousand times better than existing detectors.

At CERN, accelerator experts conceived the idea to use the Proton Synchrotron (PS) to feed two interconnected rings where two intense proton beams could be built up and then made to collide. The project for the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) was formally approved in 1965.</p>\n<p>On 27 January 1971 Kjell Johnsen (pictured), who led the construction team for the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR), announced that the world's first interactions from colliding protons had been recorded. Pictured on the left are Franco Bonaudi, who was responsible for the civil engineering and Dirk Neet, who later took charge of ISR operations.</p>\n<p>For the next 13 years the machine provided a unique view of the minuscule world of particle physics.

For example, it was here that Simon van der Meer&rsquo;s ideas to produce intense beams by a process called \"stochastic cooling\" were first demonstrated.</p>\n",

A gift from the Swiss Confederation, the Globe is an iconic wooden structure first used for the Swiss national exhibition in 2002 as a pavilion dedicated to the theme of sustainable development. It was designed by architects Thomas B&uuml;chi and Herv&eacute; Dessimoz of Geneva. The Globe is being developed into a new visitor and networking centre for the Laboratory &mdash; a focal point for CERN&rsquo;s interaction with society.</p>\n<p>The inauguration of the Globe in 2004 coincided with the official celebration of CERN&rsquo;s anniversary, attended by representatives of the Organization&rsquo;s 20 member states including the heads of state of France, Spain and Switzerland.</p>\n",

					      "description":"<p>The ATLAS Barrel Toroid, then the largest superconducting magnet ever built, was switched on for the first time at CERN on 20 November 2006. The magnet is called the Barrel Toroid because of its barrel-like shape.</p>\n<p>It provides a powerful magnetic field for ATLAS, one of the major particle detectors taking data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The magnet consists of eight superconducting coils, each in the shape of a round-cornered rectangle, 5 metres wide, 25m long and weighing 100 tonnes, all aligned to millimetre precision.</p>\n<p>The ATLAS Barrel Toroid was cooled down over a six-week period from July to August 2006 to reach &ndash;269&deg;C . It was then powered up step-by-step to higher and higher currents, reaching 21 thousand amps for the first time during the night of 9 November. Afterwards, the current was switched off and the stored magnetic energy of 1.1 GigaJoules, the equivalent of about 10,000 cars travelling at 70 kilometres per hour, was safely dissipated, raising the cold mass of the magnet to &ndash;218&deg;C.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2006/11/worlds-largest-superconducting-magnet-switches\">Read the press release</a></p>\n",

Their results were based on the analysis of considerably more data than those presented at the summer conferences, enough to make significant progress in the search for the Higgs boson, but not enough to make any conclusive statement on the existence or non-existence of the elusive Higgs. The main conclusion was that the Standard Model Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 116-130 GeV by the ATLAS experiment, and 115-127 GeV by CMS. Tantalising hints were seen by both experiments in this mass region, but they were not yet strong enough to claim a discovery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
